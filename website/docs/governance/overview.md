# Governance Framework

The European Civic Resilience Programme (ECRP) is governed by a comprehensive and transparent framework designed to ensure procedural integrity, educational neutrality, participant safety, and public accountability.

This Governance Framework defines the principles, rules, and safeguards that apply to all ECRP activities, including training programmes, immersive simulations, facilitator accreditation, certification, partnerships, and data protection.

All documents listed below form part of the Official Governance Pack of ECRP.
