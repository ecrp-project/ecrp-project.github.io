# Implementation Guidelines

## 1. Purpose of the Guidelines

These Implementation Guidelines provide practical and operational guidance for the organisation and facilitation of activities conducted under the European Civic Resilience Programme (ECRP).

They complement, but do not replace, the binding Implementation Rules. In the event of any inconsistency, the Implementation Rules shall prevail.

---

## 2. Role of Organisers

Organisers are responsible for the overall planning and execution of ECRP activities.

In particular, organisers should:

- ensure that all activities comply with the ECRP Project Charter and governance documents;
- verify that facilitators hold valid ECRP qualifications;
- provide appropriate venues, materials, and logistical support;
- ensure that participation is voluntary and informed;
- establish clear channels for participant feedback and concerns.

---

## 3. Role of Facilitators

Facilitators play a central role in ensuring the educational integrity of ECRP activities.

Facilitators should:

- maintain a neutral and non-directive stance;
- enforce procedural rules consistently and transparently;
- encourage inclusive participation and respectful dialogue;
- manage time and group dynamics effectively;
- conduct structured debriefings following immersive simulations.

Facilitators should not evaluate participants on the basis of opinions expressed or strategic success within simulations.

## 4. Conduct of Immersive Simulations

When conducting immersive tabletop simulations, organisers and facilitators should ensure that:

- rules are clearly explained prior to the start of the activity;
- all participants understand the fictional and educational nature of the simulation;
- participants may withdraw at any time without negative consequences;
- sufficient time is allocated for post-simulation reflection and discussion.

Reflective components should focus on decision-making processes, institutional dynamics, and collective reasoning rather than outcomes.

---

## 5. Reflective Assignments

Where reflective assignments are used, they should:

- be clearly explained in advance;
- focus on analysis and reflection rather than personal disclosure;
- be assessed according to transparent qualitative criteria;
- respect participant privacy and data protection requirements.

---

## 6. Documentation and Record-Keeping

Organisers and facilitators are encouraged to maintain records sufficient to:

- confirm participation;
- support certification procedures;
- identify areas for improvement.

All records must be handled in accordance with the Data Protection and Privacy Policy.

---

## 7. Continuous Improvement

ECRP activities should be subject to periodic review based on:

- participant feedback;
- facilitator observations;
- operational experience.

Insights gained through implementation may inform future updates to guidelines, without altering the core principles of the Programme.
