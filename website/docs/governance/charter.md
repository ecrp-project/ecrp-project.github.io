# Project Charter

## 1. Programme Identity

The **European Civic Resilience Programme (ECRP)** is an educational initiative designed to strengthen civic resilience through structured deliberation, experiential learning, and guided reflection.

ECRP operates as a non-partisan, non-advocacy programme. It does not promote political positions, policy preferences, or ideological outcomes. Its purpose is to develop participants’ capacities for critical reasoning, institutional understanding, collective decision-making, and responsible civic engagement.

---

## 2. Mission and Objectives

The mission of ECRP is to enhance participants’ ability to engage constructively with complex public issues in democratic societies.

The core objectives of the Programme are to:

- foster critical thinking and reflective judgment in civic contexts;
- strengthen understanding of institutional processes and public decision-making;
- develop deliberative skills through structured discussion and simulation;
- enhance resilience against misinformation, polarisation, and simplistic narratives;
- encourage respectful engagement with diverse perspectives.

## 3. Educational Approach

ECRP is based on an experiential learning model combining:

- immersive tabletop simulations and serious games;
- structured facilitation by trained and accredited facilitators;
- guided debriefing and reflective analysis;
- clearly defined procedural rules ensuring fairness and neutrality.

Educational outcomes are assessed on the basis of participation, reflection, and procedural engagement rather than ideological alignment or performance outcomes.
